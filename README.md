======================================================

Introduction
------------

In an age where information overload is the norm and data management is a daily struggle, organizations are turning to Generative AI (Gen AI) to streamline, simplify, and supercharge their document and record management systems.
From intelligent document processing to contextual search and automated compliance, Gen AI has redefined how businesses handle records. Below, we explore the top 10 Gen AI-enabled document and record management platforms that are transforming industries in 2025.

Microsoft SharePoint Syntex
--------------------
**Why It Stands Out:**

SharePoint Syntex leverages AI to automatically tag, organize, and classify documents within SharePoint. With pre-trained AI models and integrations with Microsoft 365, it’s perfect for organizations already embedded in the Microsoft ecosystem.

**Key Features:**
AI-based metadata tagging
Content classification and compliance
Integration with Microsoft Power Platform

Google Document AI
-----------------------

**Why It Stands Out:**
